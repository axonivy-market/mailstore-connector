Connect to IMAP and POP3 mail stores.

This connector provides basic functionality to easily connect to IMAP or POP3 stores, optionally using SSL. It makes it easy to write jobs that work on emails filtered by flexible predicates and to delete or move the messages after successful handling. Additionally it provides convenience functions to extract certain parts (texts, images,...) out of emails.
